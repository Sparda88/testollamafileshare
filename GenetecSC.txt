Installing Security Center 


Pre-installation checklist for Security Center 


To make sure that your Security Center installation goes smoothly, you must perform a series of preconfiguration 
steps. 


CAUTION: Do not use the image of a configured machine to install Security Center Server on similar 
machines. Security Center installer creates unique IDs when it runs for the first time on a machine. These IDs 
are stored in configuration files and the Directory database. If these IDs are duplicated, it causes conflicts 
with the entities in the system that share the identifiers. This might make the system unusable. 


Step 
Task 
Additional information 
Review your system compatibility 


1 
Read the release notes for any known issues, 
Security Center Release Notes 
limitations, and other information about the 
release. 


2 
Review the system requirements to ensure 
Security Center System Requirements Guide 
that the minimum hardware (servers and 
workstations) and software requirements 
(Windows, web browser, and so on) are met. 


3 
Read the installation prerequisites for your 
Security Center 5.12.2.0 installation prerequisites 
release. 


Security Center Installer automatically verifies 
and installs the software prerequisites on your 
system, but it’s a good practice to know what they 
are beforehand. 


4 
Read the best practices for configuring Windows 
Best practices for configuring Windows Firewall 
to work with Security Center. To ensure the 
for Security Center 
optimal performance of your system, you must 
follow these recommendations after installing 
Security Center 


Review your system components 


5 
Security Center isn’t a life safety platform. If you 
intend to integrate any life safety component 
with your Security Center instance, you must 
follow all applicable laws and regulations, 
including any industry-specific codes. Ensure 
that your deployment and use of Security Center 
and any such life safety component complies 
with the rules and standards applicable in 
your jurisdiction, environment, and industry. 
Consult professionals in life safety compliance as 
required. 


6 
Create the list of the computers that are part 
of your new system, and decide what software 
components need to be installed on each. 


IMPORTANT: Server names must be 15 
characters or fewer. Security Center truncates all 
server names longer than 15 characters, causing 
errors when the system tries to access those 
servers. 


Your system requires the following components: 


• 
Security Center Server (main or expansion 
server) 
• 
Security Center Client (Config Tool, Security 
Desk, or both) 
• 
SQL Server (Express, Standard, or Enterprise 
edition)

Make sure you have administrative privileges. 
If not, run the installation setup.exe as

Prepare your installation package 


Security Center doesn’t modify your network 
infrastructure or how it works. Multicast works 
with Security Center by default, as long as the 
network supports the necessary load. If multicast 
is the only protocol configured, Security Center 
can’t switch to a different protocol if multicast is 
blocked, and video can’t be recorded.

Downloadable packages 


The Security Center installation packages are zip files that you can download from the GTAP Product 
Download page, at https://portal.genetec.com/support/SystemManagement/DownloadSection/. Note, you 
need a username and password to log on to GTAP. 


• 
SecurityCenterWebSetup.exe: The web installer is a small installation wizard that does not contain 
software packages. To retrieve the required software packages, the wizard connects to Genetec™ servers 
and downloads the components necessary for the features you choose to install. 
• 
Full installation package: Download the full installation package if your computers do not have access to 
the internet. This standalone package includes everything that you might need to install Security Center.

Installing Security Center 


The full installation package contains the following: 


• 
setup.exe: Found in the root folder. This is the AutoRun-enabled version of the standalone installer. 
• 
Security Center Setup.exe: Found in the SC Packages folder. This is the standalone installer. 
• 
SC Packages: This folder contains all components of the Security Center installation. The Security 
Center installation prerequisites are found here. 
• 
Documentation: This folder contains the PDF versions of the Security Center Installation and Upgrade 
Guide along with the Release Notes. 
• 
Separate component installation packages: The following installation packages are bundled in the full 
Security Center installation package, but can also be run separately. 
• 
Security Center 5.12 Documentation: This package is required to install the Security Center help 
(.exe files), accessible from Security Desk and Config Tool using the F1 button, and the Security Center 
Hardening Guide (PDF file) locally on your computer. 
Every new version of Security Center comes with the latest documentation at the time of release. 
Updated documentation can become available after the software is released to add new translations or 
to fix documentation bugs. These updates can be deployed using the Genetec™ Update Service. 
• 
Security Center Drivers 12.x.y: This package is required to integrate video devices to Security Center. 
• 
Every new version of Security Center comes with the latest drivers at the time of release. 
• 
The latest version of the Drivers package can be deployed using the Genetec Update Service. 
• 
If you accidentally remove the Drivers package from Programs and Features, your video units will 
stop working and turn red in Config Tool. To reinstall it, run Genetec Security Center Drivers 10.x.y.msi 
located in the SC Packages folder of your full Security Center installation package. 
• 
We do not recommend installing a Drivers package older than the one bundled with the Security 
Center package. 
Installation modes 


You can run the Security Center Installer in two modes: 


• 
Wizard mode: The installation wizard guides you through installing Security Center using a series of 
questions. There are two versions of the installer: 
• 
Web version: The web version downloads the components that you choose to install from the 
internet. This installer version has a small footprint because only the components that you need are 
downloaded. To run the web installer, download the file SecurityCenterWebSetup.exe from GTAP and 
double-click it. 
At the beginning of the installation, you can create a custom installation bundle that includes only 
the components that you need for your installation. This bundle is meant to replicate the current 
installation on computers with the same Windows setup. 
NOTE: To create the custom installation bundle, you must select this option while you are installing or 
upgrading Security Center. After the version you want has been installed, you cannot re-run the web 
setup to create the custom bundle. 
• 
Standard version: Use the standard version if your computer is not connected to the internet. This 
large installer includes everything that you might need in the installation package. To run the standard 
installer, download the full installation package from GTAP, copy the package to the target computer, 
and double-click setup.exe found in the root folder of the package. 


• 
Silent mode: The silent mode is used to run the installer from the command line, without user 
intervention. 
IMPORTANT: The Security Center Installer does not support mapped drives in your path specifications.

Installing Security Center 


Installer languages 


The Security Center Installer is available in English and French, but the Security Center software can be 
installed in more than twenty different languages. You can select the language of the installer from within 
the wizard.

Reducing the package size for client installations 


To ease the download and distribution of Security Center to your remote sites, you can greatly reduce the 
size of the installation package if you want to install only client applications. 


What you should know 


The full standalone Security Center installation package is roughly 4.6 GB. If you need to install only the client 
applications – Security Desk and Config Tool – you can eliminate the prerequisites that are required only for 
server installations. This reduces the size of the installation package by more than half. 


TIP: You can use the web installer to create a custom installation bundle with only the components you 
need based on a first installation. However, the custom bundle can be used only to replicate the same 
installation on machines that have the same Windows setup as your first machine. If you plan on installing 
client applications on machines with different Windows setup, you must follow the current procedure. 


Procedure 


1 
Download a copy of the full installation package from Genetec™ Portal (GTAP). 


2 
Unzip the package to a temporary folder. 


3 
Delete the Documentation folder. 


This folder contains the Security Center Installation and Upgrade Guide and Release Notes in PDF format in 
multiple languages. You save roughly 21 MB. 
TIP: If you need these documents later, you can download them individually from TechDoc Hub. 


4 
Open the SC Packages folder. 


5 
Delete the SQLExpress folder. 


A client-only installation does not require Microsoft SQL Server Express Edition. You save roughly 2.20 GB. 


6 
If you do not need Genetec™ Video Player, delete the Genetec Video Player folder. 


You save roughly 606 MB. If you need it later, you can download it separately from GTAP. 


After you finish 


Use the reduced package to install Security Center Client on other machines. Use the following sample silent 
installation commands: 


• 
Install all client applications with Genetec™ Video Player: 
"Security Center Setup.exe" /silent /debuglog"C:\MyLogs\DebugLog.log" / 
log"C:\MyLogs\" /ISFeatureInstall=Client AGREETOLICENSE=YesSERVERADMIN_PASSWORD=”SeCret123!” 


• 
Install all client applications without Genetec Video Player: 
"Security Center Setup.exe" /silent /debuglog"C:\MyLogs\DebugLog.log" / 
log"C:\MyLogs\" /ISFeatureInstall=Client AGREETOLICENSE=YesSERVERADMIN_PASSWORD=”SeCret123!” INSTALL_GVP=0

Installing Security Center 


Installing Security Center 


When you are ready to install Security Center, you must perform the following steps. 


Before you begin 


Go through the pre-installation checklist. 


What you should know 


IMPORTANT: 


• 
If you need to install the Security Center Server on a computer after you have installed Security Center 
Client, always use the downloaded Security Center package. Using the Change option from Programs and 
Features does not install the SQL Server Express component. 
• 
The Security Center Installer does not support the use of mapped drives in your path specifications. 
• 
During the Security Center installation, you are given the option of allowing Security Center to create 
firewall rules for its applications. If you select this option, all Security Center applications are added as 
exceptions to the internal Windows firewall. However, you still must ensure that all the ports used by 
Security Center are open on your network. 
• 
The installation progress bar might turn yellow. This indicates that a reboot is required which you will be 
prompted to do after the installation is completed. No further action is needed. 
• 
You can configure different port numbers than the ones that are used by default. 
Procedure 


1 
(Optional) Install SQL Server independently of Security Center. 
SQL Server Express is typically installed automatically with Security Center. Installing SQL Server 
separately depends on your deployment requirements. 


2 
Install Security Center components on the main server that will host the Directory role. 


3 
Activate your product license on the main server. 


4 
Make sure that all ports used by Security Center are open and redirected for the purposes of firewall and 
network address translation. 
For more information, see Default ports used by Security Center 5.12. 


5 
Configure Genetec™ Update Service (GUS). 
For more information, see the Genetec Update Service User Guide. 


6 
(Optional) Install Security Center components on expansion servers that will connect to the main server to 
add processing power to your Security Center system. 


7 
Install Security Center Client (Config Tool, Security Desk, or both). 


After you finish 


Go through the post-installation checklist. 


Ports used by core applications in Security Center 


The following table lists the default network ports that must be opened to allow proper communication 
between the core applications and services in Security Center. 


For a visual representation of the ports, see the Security Center Network Diagram - Platform.

Installing Security Center 


IMPORTANT: Exposing Security Center to the internet is discouraged without hardening your system 
first. Before exposing your system, implement the advanced security level described in the Security Center 
Hardening Guide to help protect your system from internet threats. Alternatively, use a trusted VPN for 
remote connections.

http.sys require the following rule: dir="in" protocol="6" lport="<SPECIFY PORT USED HERE: CAN BE 80, 443, or 
CUSTOM>" binary="System". 


2 TCP port 960 applies to new installations of Security Center 5.8 and later. In Security Center 5.6 and 5.7, 
TCP port 5004 was used instead of TCP port 960. Therefore, any system upgraded to 5.12 through 5.6 or 5.7 
continues to use TCP port 5004. 


Ports used by AutoVu applications in Security Center 


The following tables lists the default network ports that must be opened to allow proper communication 
between Security Center and external AutoVu™ components when AutoVu is enabled in your system.

1 You can also add a SharpV to Security Center as a standard video unit using separate Archiver and Media 
Router roles. For more information on adding a video unit, see Ports used by Omnicast applications in 
Security Center on page 17. 


Ports used by Omnicast applications in Security Center 


The following table lists the default network ports that must be opened to allow proper communication 
between Security Center and external IP video devices when Omnicast™ is enabled in your system. 


For a visual representation of the ports, see the Security Center Network Diagram - Video. 


IMPORTANT: Exposing Security Center to the internet is discouraged without hardening your system 
first. Before exposing your system, implement the advanced security level described in the Security Center 
Hardening Guide to help protect your system from internet threats. Alternatively, use a trusted VPN for 
remote connections.

1 Applies to servers hosting one Archiver role. If multiple Archiver roles are hosted on the same server, each 
additional role uses the next free port. 


2 You can have multiple Archiver agents on the same server. Each Archiver agent assigns a unique UDP 
port to each video unit that it controls. To ensure that the UDP port assignment on a server is unique, each 
additional Archiver agent on the same server adds 5000 to its starting UDP port number. For example, the 
first Archiver agent uses ports 15000-19999, the second one uses ports 20000-24999, the third one uses ports 
25000-29999, and so on. 


NOTE: You can manually assign live streaming reception UDP ports from the Resource tab of the Archiver 
role. 


3 TCP port 960 applies to new installations of Security Center 5.8 and later. In Security Center 5.6 and 5.7, 
TCP port 5004 was used instead of TCP port 960. Therefore, any system upgraded to 5.12 through 5.6 or 5.7 
continues to use TCP port 5004. 


4 In the context of Cloud Storage, ports TCP 80, 443, and 570 are only used when Cloud Storage is enabled. 


Ports used by KiwiVision modules in Security Center 


The following tables list the default network ports that must be opened to allow proper communication 
between Security Center and external IP video devices when KiwiVision™ is enabled in your system.

Installing Security Center 


Ports used by intrusion-detection applications in Security Center 


Default network ports must be opened to allow proper communication between Security Center and 
intrusion panels through intrusion panel extensions. 


For the list of ports required for your intrusion detection system, refer to the following: 


• 
The extension guide for your intrusion panel extension. 
• 
Security Center Network Diagram - Intrusion Detection, for a visual representation of the ports. 
IMPORTANT: Exposing Security Center to the internet is discouraged without hardening your system 
first. Before exposing your system, implement the advanced security level described in the Security Center 
Hardening Guide to help protect your system from internet threats. Alternatively, use a trusted VPN for 
remote connections. 


Ports used by Sipelia modules in Security Center 


For proper communication between Security Center and external IP video devices when Sipelia™ is enabled in 
your system, you must open the default network ports. 


Default ports for Sipelia Server 


IMPORTANT: When configuring ports, ensure that the ports are open and not used by another application 
on the same workstation. For example, if Sipelia Server is installed on the same machine that hosts the 
Genetec™ Server, you can’t use a port that is already used by Security Center or another application.

Installing Security Center 


Installing SQL Server independently of Security Center 


Depending on your deployment requirements, you might have to install SQL Server before you install 
Security Center. The most common reasons are to install SQL Server on a drive that is separate from the 
system drive (typically the C: drive), or on a server that is separate from all Security Center servers. 


Before you begin 


If you are installing SQL Server Standard or Enterprise edition, you must purchase it from Microsoft, and 
download the installation package. The installer for SQL Server Express is included in the Security Center 
installation package. SQL Server Express works only on 64-bit operating systems. 


What you should know 


There are many reasons why you must install SQL Server yourself. The most obvious one is when SQL Server 
Express does not satisfy your database requirements. Even when SQL Server Express is all you need, you 
might still have to install it yourself for the following reasons: 


• 
You plan on setting up a role failover. In this case, install SQL Server on a server that is different from all 
servers hosting the Security Center role. 
• 
Microsoft Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) is enabled on your server. In this case, install SQL Server on 
a drive that is separate from the system drive, and make sure that VSS takes only snapshots of the system 
drive. 
CAUTION: Do not disable VSS. Disabling VSS interferes with the operation of Windows System Restore. 


Procedure 


1 
Do one of the following: 


• 
If you are installing SQL Server Standard or Enterprise: 
a. 
In Windows, navigate to the SQL installation package folder. 
b. 
Double-click Setup.exe. 
• 
If you are installing SQL Server Express: 
a. 
In Windows, navigate to the Security Center installation package folder. 
b. 
Open the folder SC Packages\SQLExpress. 
c. 
Double-click SQLEXPRADV_x64_ENU.exe.

On the Service Logon Parameters page, set the username and password used to run Security Center 
services. 



a) 
Select one of the following options: 
• 
Use default name and password: Select this option to use the LocalSystem account to run your 
Security Center services. The LocalSystem account has extensive privileges on the local computer 
and acts as the computer on the network. 
• 
Specify the username and password for all services: Select this option if you want to restrict 
the privileges granted to the service user. Enter a valid domain username and a strong password, 
and record them in a safe place. You must provide these credentials every time you upgrade your 
Security Center software. Use industry best practices for creating strong passwords. 
IMPORTANT: Make sure that the service user is a local administrator and not a domain 
administrator. The service user must have sufficient rights to the local or remote database, and Log 
on as service user rights. If this server hosts the Active Directory role, the specified user must also 
have read and write access to the Active Directory that you want the server to connect to. 


NOTE: The service user automatically creates all the necessary databases when the system is 
started for the first time. For this reason, the service user needs the SQL Server role, dbCreator, for 
its first run. After the databases are created, you can remove the dbCreator role. 


To avoid having to grant the dbCreator role to the service user, you can create the databases 
required by the Security Center roles yourself, as empty databases. When the system is started for 
the first time, the service user has to create only the tables, without going through the database 
creations. For the list of Security Center roles that need a database and the minimum SQL Server 
roles they require, see About connecting to SQL Server with an account that has administrative 
privileges. 


You can also deny the service user the dbCreator role and create the databases later. In this 
case, the Security Center roles that require a database fail at system startup. Then create the 
databases and restart each role manually. You can also change the service user later from 
Microsoft Management Console.

a) 
Complete the following fields: 
• 
Server port: The TCP port through which the servers in your system communicate. 
• 
Web server port: The HTTP port that is used for the web-based Server Admin. If you change the 
default port, the Server Admin address must include the port number in the URL. For example, 
http://computer:port/Genetec instead of http://computer/Genetec. The link to Server Admin, accessible 
through Start menu, automatically includes this port. 
CAUTION: Watch out for conflicts with other software, such as a Skype, running on the server that 
might use port 80. 


• 
Password and Confirm password: Enter and confirm the password to open the web-based Server 
Admin. 
BEST PRACTICE: If you are upgrading your Security Center installation, the existing server 
password is kept by default. If you are using a blank password, we recommend that you enter a 
new one that contains at least one uppercase character, one lowercase character, one number, and 
one special character. 


IMPORTANT: If you lose the server password, call Genetec Technical Support to reset it.

Always validate the Directory certificate: Select this option to force all client and server 
applications on the current machine to validate the identity certificate of the Directory before 
connecting to it. 
BEST PRACTICE: If you enable Directory authentication, use a certificate issued by a trusted 
certificate authority (CA). Otherwise, the first time this computer connects to the Directory, the user 
is prompted to confirm the identity of the Directory server. 


For more information, see What is Directory authentication?. 


• 
Refuse basic authentication: Basic access authentication for cameras is turned off by default to 
prevent camera credentials from being compromised when the Archiver connects to a video unit. 
IMPORTANT: When this option is selected, cameras that support only basic access authentication 
do not work. 


TIP: Most recent video unit models support digest access authentication. If you are not sure 
whether your cameras support digest or not, leave the default setting as is. After installation, if 
some cameras do not work, you can always turn basic access authentication on again.

Installing Security Center 


BEST PRACTICE: Replace (local) with either the computer name or hostname, and port, if required. 


For example: DB_SERVER.GENETEC.COM,1433\SQLEXPRESS 


Use a computer name or hostname if you are configuring the Directory for load balancing. For more 
information, see Directory failover and load balancing. 


If you are upgrading from a supported version of Security Center, the installer automatically upgrades 
all databases that your system requires. 


If you are using an old version of SQL Server Express, you can upgrade your database server to SQL 
Server 2022 Express Advanced if the following conditions are met: 


• 
You are running a version of Windows that supports SQL Server 2022 Express Advanced. This 
means the 64-bit version of Windows 10, Windows 11, or Windows Server 2016 or later. 
• 
Your current version of SQL Server is upgradable to SQL Server 2022 Express Advanced. This means 
one of the following versions: 
• 
SQL Server 2012 SP4 Express, version 11.0.7001.0 or later 
• 
SQL Server 2014 SP3 Express, version 12.0.6024.0 or later 
• 
SQL Server 2016 SP3 Express, version 13.0.6300.2 or later 
• 
SQL Server 2017 Express, version 14.0.1000.169 or later 
• 
SQL Server 2019 Express, version 15.0.2000.5 or later 
• 
Install a new database server: 
Installs Microsoft SQL Server 2022 Express Advanced on this 
computer. You must choose a database server name. The default is SQLEXPRESS. 
NOTE: The database server name is not case-sensitive but must meet all following criteria: 


• 
It cannot be the same name as an existing SQL instance on your server. 
• 
It cannot match any of the SQL Server reserved keywords, such as DEFAULT, PRIMARY, and so on. 
• 
It cannot be longer than 16 characters. 
• 
The first character of the instance name must be a letter or an underscore (_). Acceptable letters are 
defined by the Unicode Standard 2.0, including Latin characters a-z and A-Z, and letter characters 
from other languages. 
• 
Subsequent characters can be letters defined by the Unicode Standard 2.0, decimal numbers from 
Basic Latin, or other national scripts, the dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). 
• 
It cannot contain spaces or the following characters: \ , : ; ' & # @ 
NOTE: SQL Server 2022 Express is supported only on the 64-bit version of Windows 10, Windows 11, 
and Windows Server 2016 and later. If the version of Windows you are running is not one of these, 
quit the Security Center installation, download SQL Server 2014 Express SP3 from Microsoft Download 
Center, and install it first before installing Security Center. 
• 
Use an existing Azure SQL database: Selects a predefined Microsoft Azure SQL database. 
• 
Do not select a database server now: Install this expansion server without a database. Roles that 
need a database cannot be hosted on this server. A SQL database can be added later.

On the Database Server Authentication page, select the database server authentication method. 



a) 
Select one of the following options: 
• 
Windows authentication: This is the default option. We recommend using this method wherever 
possible. With Windows authentication, users who are already logged on to Windows do not need 
to log on separately to SQL Server. The only time you cannot use Windows authentication is if you 
are using an Azure SQL database. 
• 
SQL Server and Windows authentication (mixed mode): Use the mixed mode if you are using an

On the Service Logon Parameters page, set the username and password used to run Security Center 
services. 



a) 
Select one of the following options: 
• 
Use default name and password: Select this option to use the LocalSystem account to run your 
Security Center services. The LocalSystem account has extensive privileges on the local computer 
and acts as the computer on the network. 
• 
Specify the username and password for all services: Select this option if you want to restrict 
the privileges granted to the service user. Enter a valid domain username and a strong password, 
and record them in a safe place. You must provide these credentials every time you upgrade your 
Security Center software. Use industry best practices for creating strong passwords. 
IMPORTANT: Make sure that the service user is a local administrator and not a domain 
administrator. The service user must have sufficient rights to the local or remote database, and Log 
on as service user rights. If this server hosts the Active Directory role, the specified user must also 
have read and write access to the Active Directory that you want the server to connect to. 


NOTE: The service user automatically creates all the necessary databases when the system is 
started for the first time. For this reason, the service user needs the SQL Server role, dbCreator, for 
its first run. After the databases are created, you can remove the dbCreator role. 


To avoid having to grant the dbCreator role to the service user, you can create the databases 
required by the Security Center roles yourself, as empty databases. When the system is started for 
the first time, the service user has to create only the tables, without going through the database 
creations. For the list of Security Center roles that need a database and the minimum SQL Server 
roles they require, see About connecting to SQL Server with an account that has administrative 
privileges. 


You can also deny the service user the dbCreator role and create the databases later. In this 
case, the Security Center roles that require a database fail at system startup. Then create the 
databases and restart each role manually. You can also change the service user later from 
Microsoft Management Console.

a) 
Configure the following settings: 
• 
Always validate the Directory certificate: Select this option to force all client and server 
applications on the current machine to validate the identity certificate of the Directory before 
connecting to it. 
BEST PRACTICE: If you enable Directory authentication, use a certificate issued by a trusted 
certificate authority (CA). Otherwise, the first time this computer connects to the Directory, the user 
is prompted to confirm the identity of the Directory server. 


For more information, see What is Directory authentication?. 


• 
Refuse basic authentication: Basic access authentication for cameras is turned off by default to 
prevent camera credentials from being compromised when the Archiver connects to a video unit. 
IMPORTANT: When this option is selected, cameras that support only basic access authentication 
do not work. 


TIP: Most recent video unit models support digest access authentication. If you are not sure 
whether your cameras support digest or not, leave the default setting as is. After installation, if 
some cameras do not work, you can always turn basic access authentication on again. 


• 
Automatically check for security and enhancement updates for Genetec™ products: Select this 
option to allow GUS to check automatically for updates of all installed Genetec products. 
• 
Enable Genetec™ Update Service (GUS) integration in Security Center: Enable this option to 
make GUS available in Config Tool. 
b) 
Select I acknowledge that I have read and understood the implications of selecting these 
security settings, and click Install to start the installation.

Before you begin 


After successfully installing an expansion server, it automatically connects to the main server. These steps are 
necessary only if:

Installing Security Center 


• 
You entered the wrong connection parameters to the main server during the expansion server 
installation. 
• 
You moved the main server to a different computer. 
• 
You changed the password on the main server. 
• 
You enabled Directory authentication on your expansion server, but your Directory certificate is not 
signed by a trusted certificate authority. 
Procedure 


1 
Open the Server Admin web page on the expansion server by doing one of the following: 


• 
In the address bar of your web browser, type https://computer:port/Genetec, where computer is the 
hostname or the IP address of your expansion server, and port is the web server port specified during 
the Security Center Server installation. 
You can omit the web server port if you are using the default value (443). 


• 
If connecting to Server Admin from the local host, double-click Genetec™ Server Admin ( 
) in the 
Genetec Security Center folder in the Windows Start menu. 
2 
Enter the password and click Log on. The initial expansion server password is the main server password 
that was entered during the expansion server installation. This password is synchronized with the current 
main server password after the expansion server successfully connects to the main server. 



The Server Admin Overview page appears.

a) 
Click Main server connection. 
b) 
In the dialog box, verify that the certificate of your main server is as expected, and click Accept 
certificate. 
IMPORTANT: The accepted certificate is stored in a local allowlist, and you should not be prompted to 


accept it again. If you are, then you should immediately notify your IT department. 
BEST PRACTICE: To avoid having to accept the main server certificate every time someone connects 
to it from a new machine, use only certificates signed by a certification authority that is trusted by your 
company's IT. 


c) 
Click Save. 
d) 
When prompted to restart the service, click Yes. 
While the Genetec™ Server service restarts, you are temporarily logged off from Server Admin. 
The expansion server is now connected to the main server. The two servers can remain connected, even 
when you change the certificate, on one or both of the servers. For this to work, the two servers must be 
connected while the change is made.

Upgrading to Security Center 5.12 


Preparing to upgrade from an earlier release of Security 
Center 5.12 


If you need to upgrade from an earlier release of Security Center 5.12 to 5.12.2.0, you must prepare the 
following. 


What you should know 


A minor version is a software version that adds new features, SDK capabilities, support for new devices, bug 
fixes, and security fixes. Different system components can run at different minor versions, provided they 
share the same major version. No license update is required to upgrade to a new minor version. A minor 
version is indicated by a version number with a zero at the fourth position: X.Y.Z.0. 


A patch version is a software version that adds support for new devices, bug fixes, and security fixes. Patch 
versions do not affect system compatibility, as long as all your system components are at the same major 
version. A patch version is indicated by a version number where the fourth position is not a zero. 


Procedure 


• 
Make sure you have the following information: 
• 
The service logon username and password for all your servers. 
• 
The name of the database server used to manage the Directory database. 
You'll have to re-enter the same values when you install Security Center Server 5.12.2.0.

Upgrading to Security Center 5.12 


Upgrading from an earlier release of Security Center 5.12 


To have the latest release of Security Center 5.12, you can upgrade from an earlier minor version of 5.12 to 


5.12.2.0after you have completed the preparation steps. 
Before you begin 


• 
Understand the things you need to know and do before you upgrade. 
• 
Back up your Directory database, and all role databases. 
• 
In Security Center 5.11.3.0 and later, Omnicast™ Federation™ is not supported. If you have Omnicast 
systems federated to your system, Omnicast Federation roles will be in a permanent warning state after 
the upgrade. 
NOTE: Omnicast Federation will be disabled in an upcoming major release. Upgrade your Omnicast 
systems to a supported Security Center version as soon as possible. 


What you should know 


You do not need to change your license when you upgrade from an earlier minor version of 5.12 to 5.12.2.0 
because they share the same major version. 


Previous installation choices, such as language and installation types are preserved, and the InstallShield 
Wizard will not ask for them again. 


Procedure 


1 
Upgrade your main server to Security Center 5.12.2.0. 
2 
Upgrade your expansion servers to Security Center 5.12.2.0, according to your priorities. 
3 
Upgrade your client workstations to Security Center 5.12.2.0, according to your priorities. 


After you finish 


If the file AllowedSynchronizationConfiguration.xml was used to set the synchronization times of your HID VertX 


units, the settings must be re-applied manually from Config Tool after the upgrade. 
TIP: Configure one unit with the required synchronization settings, then use the Copy configuration tool to 
set the same settings on multiple units.

Upgrading to Security Center 5.12 


Pre-upgrade checklist for upgrading from an earlier major 
version of Security Center 


To upgrade your Security Center system from an earlier major version to 5.12.2.0, you must go through a 
series of preparatory steps. 


• 
A major version is a software version that adds new features, behavioral changes, SDK capabilities, 
support for new devices, and performance improvements. Using backward compatibility mode, major 
versions are compatible with up to three previous major versions. A license update is required to upgrade 
to a new major version. A major version is indicated by a version number with zeros at the third and 
fourth positions: X.Y.0.0. 
• 
Different versions of the Security Center clients can coexist on the same machine, but different versions 
of Security Center Server cannot. Not all current settings are kept if you uninstall your current software 
version before installing the new one. 
• 
If the Active Directory role is on a different domain than the Active Directory it is synchronizing with, you 
must set up a domain trust relationship. For more information on setting up domain trust relationships, 
see your Microsoft documentation.

with your Windows Active Directory after the 
upgrade. 


Backward compatibility requirements for Security Center 


Security Center 5.12.2.0 is backward-compatible with many Security Center components from the three 
previous major versions. A server or workstation that is three major versions behind can connect to the 


5.12.2.0Directory, but one that is four major versions behind cannot. 
To retain backward compatibility when upgrading your system in stages, no part of Security Center can be 
more than three major versions apart. For systems that are four to six major versions behind, upgrade in two 
steps to maintain backward compatibility. 


IMPORTANT: Adding backward-compatible connections slows down the performance of the Directory. It is 


recommended only as a temporary solution before you can upgrade all servers and workstations. 
IMPORTANT: For client workstations, backward compatibility applies only to Security Desk. Config Tool is not 
backward-compatible because it must be of the same version as the Directory. 


Backward compatibility in Security Center has the following requirements: 


• 
Upgrading to the latest version: When upgrading, you must always upgrade the main server that hosts 
the Directory role and Config Tool. Always upgrade expansion servers that host non-backward-compatible 
roles. 
• 
Using new features: To use the new features introduced in version 5.12.2.0, upgrade your Security 
Center servers. 
• 
Role assigned to multiple servers: If a role is assigned to multiple servers, such as in a failover 
configuration, all of its servers must run the same version of Security Center. 
• 
Directory assigned to multiple servers: All Directory servers must use the same version, meaning that 
all four digits of their version numbers must be the same. For example, if you upgrade to Security Center 
5.12.2.0, you must upgrade all servers to 5.12.2.0. 
For information on enabling and disabling backward compatibility, see Enabling backward compatibility and 
Disabling backward compatibility on the TechDoc Hub. 


Backward compatibility between Security Center roles 


Each new version of Security Center includes new role features that might be incompatible with earlier 


versions. The Security Center roles that are backward-compatible are outlined in the following table. 
IMPORTANT: All expansion servers that host a non-backward-compatible role must be upgraded to the 
same version as the main server hosting the Directory.

Upgrading to Security Center 5.12 


Backing up databases 


You can protect your Security Center system data by regularly backing up its databases to a secure location 
that is separate from your main server. It is best practice to back up your databases before an upgrade. 


What you should know 


CAUTION: Do not use virtual machine snapshots to back up your Security Center databases. During the 
snapshot process, all I/Os on the virtual machine are suspended, which can affect the stability and the 
performance of your system. We strongly recommend that you follow the procedure described below. 


Depending on which role database you want to back up, the procedure can be different. 


Procedure 


1 
For the Directory database without failover, perform the backup from Server Admin. 


2 
For the Directory database with failover, perform the backup from the Directory Manager's Directory 
failover page in Config Tool. 


3 
For any other Security Center role database, perform the backup from Config Tool, on the Resources page 
of the role. 


4 
For the Archiver and Auxiliary Archiver roles, after backing up the database, perform an archive transfer 
to back up the video files. 


Backing up the Directory database 


You back up the Directory database from Server Admin. 


Before you begin 


• 
For non-Directory databases, see Backing up role databases on page 102. 
• 
If the Backup and restore failover mode is enabled, perform the backup from Config Tool 
What you should know 


There are restrictions regarding the backup and restore of the Directory database when the Mirroring 
failover mode is enabled. For more information, refer to the Microsoft SQL Server Database Mirroring 
documentation. 


Procedure 


1 
Log on to Server Admin on your computer using a web browser. 


2 
From the server list, select the main server ( 
). 
The Server Admin - Main server page is displayed. 


3 
Click Database properties ( 
) and configure the backup settings: 


• 
Destination folder: Path to the backup folder relative to the server performing the backup. By default, 
databases are backed up to C:\SecurityCenterBackup on the database server, and configuration files 
are backed up to the same folder on the server hosting the role. If the folder does not exist, it will 
be created. To save your backups on a shared network drive, enter the path manually, and ensure

that both the Genetec™ Server service user and the SQL Server service user have write access to that 
location. 


• 
Compress backup file: (Optional) Select this option to create a ZIP file instead of a BAK file. If you 
select this option, you need to unzip the backup file before you can restore it. 
IMPORTANT: The Compress backup file option only works if the database is local to the server 
hosting the role. 


• 
Enable automatic backup: (Optional but recommended) Select this option to enable automatic 
backup on a schedule. Specify the frequency and time of the backup, and how many backup files you 
want to keep. 
NOTE: Backup files you create manually are not counted in the number of retained backup files. 


4 
Click OK > Save 


5 
Click Backup/Restore ( 
) and then click Backup now. 
The backup starts and the progress is shown in the dialog box. 
6 
When the task is completed, click OK. 
A backup file is created in the backup folder with the file extension BAK (or ZIP if the Compress backup file 
option was selected). The name of the file is the database name, followed by “_ManualBackup_”, and the 
current date and time. 


Backing up role databases 


You back up a role database from Config Tool, from the role's Resources page. 


Before you begin 


For the Directory database, see Backing up the Directory database on page 101. 


What you should know 


You protect the data managed by a role by backing up its database. For the Archiver and Auxiliary Archiver 
roles, you also need to back up the video archive because the associated video files are not stored in the 
database. 


Procedure 
1 
From the Config Tool homepage, open the System task and click the Roles view. 
2 
Select a role, and click the Resources tab. 


3 
Click Backup/Restore ( 
).

4 
In the Backup/Restore dialog box, beside the Backup folder field, click Select folder ( 
), and select the 
folder where you want to save the backup file. 
IMPORTANT: Make sure you select a separate and secure location to store your backups. 



NOTE: The location of the Backup folder is relative to the server performing the backup. By default, 
databases are backed up to C:\SecurityCenterBackup on the database server, and configuration files are 
backed up to the same folder on the server hosting the role. If the folder does not exist, it will be created. 
To save your backups on a shared network drive, enter the path manually, and ensure that both the 
Genetec™ Server service user and the SQL Server service user have write access to that location. 


5 
(Optional) Turn on the Compress backup file option to create a ZIP file instead of a BAK file. 
If you select this option, you need to unzip the backup file before you can restore it. 
IMPORTANT: The Compress backup file option only works if the database is local to the server hosting 


the role. 


6 
Click Backup now. 


A backup file is created in the backup folder with the file extension BAK. The name of the file is the database 
name, followed by “_ManualBackup_”, and the current date and time.

Upgrading Security Center 5.9, 5.10, or 5.11 to 5.12 


To have the latest release of Security Center, you can upgrade directly from the previous three major versions 
to 5.12. 


Before you begin 


• 
Understand the things you need to know and do before you upgrade. 
• 
In Security Center 5.12.0.0 and later, Omnicast™ Federation™ is disabled and no longer supported. Remove 
all Omnicast Federation roles before upgrading your system. 
What you should know 


Not all tasks and roles work in backward compatibility mode. If you plan to upgrade your system in stages, 
make sure that the features that are essential to your operation are supported. See Backward compatibility 
requirements for Security Center on page 95. 


NOTE: A role is upgraded only if you upgrade the server hosting the role. If you upgrade only the main 
server, the roles hosted on the expansion servers that are not yet upgraded work in backward compatibility 
mode. 


IMPORTANT: If you upgrade the ALPR Manager, the Archiver it is linked to must also be upgraded. The 
upgraded ALPR Manager does not work if the Archiver is working in backward compatibility mode. 


Procedure 


1 
Do one of the following: 


• 
If you have multiple Directory systems, upgrade all your Directory servers at the same time. 
• 
If you have a single Directory system, upgrade your main server. 
2 
Upgrade the rest of your system according to your priorities and schedule. 


• 
Upgrade your expansion servers. 
IMPORTANT: If role failover is configured, upgrade all servers assigned to the same role at the same 
time. Failing to do so breaks your failover configuration. 


• 
Upgrade your client workstations. 
If both Security Center Client and Server are installed on the same machine, upgrade them together. 
IMPORTANT: Make sure to note and apply the same settings used for your previous installation: 
passwords, databases, ports, general properties, and so on. 


After you finish 


If the file AllowedSynchronizationConfiguration.xml was used to set the synchronization times of your HID VertX 


units, the settings must be re-applied manually from Config Tool after the upgrade. 
TIP: Configure one unit with the required synchronization settings, then use the Copy configuration tool to 
set the same settings on multiple units.

Upgrading to Security Center 5.12 


Upgrading Security Center from 5.6, 5.7, or 5.8 to 5.12 


To maintain backward compatibility while upgrading Security Center 5.6, 5.7, or 5.8 to 5.12, you must follow a 
two-step upgrade process. 


Before you begin 


Understand the things you need to know and do before you upgrade. 


What you should know 


To retain backward compatibility when upgrading your system in stages, no part of Security Center can be 
more than three major versions apart. For systems that are four to six major versions behind, upgrade in two 
steps to maintain backward compatibility. 


Procedure 


1 
Upgrade your system to the latest Security Center 5.9 release. 


You need a temporary license and the latest Security Center installation package. Ask one of our 


representatives. 


a) 
Upgrade your main server to Security Center 5.9. 
Follow the upgrade instructions found in the Security Center Installation and Upgrade Guide 5.9 SR5. 
b) 
Turn your system on. 
All servers and workstations that are not yet upgraded run in backward compatibility mode. This is the 
first stage. 


c) 
Upgrade the rest of your system (servers and workstations) to the latest 5.9 release. 
Your entire system runs in version 5.9. This is the second stage. You can split this step into as many 
stages as needed, depending on the number of machines you need to upgrade. 


2 
Upgrade your system to Security Center 5.12.

Upgrading to Security Center 5.12 


Removing Omnicast Federation before upgrading Security 
Center 


Omnicast™ Federation™ roles and Omnicast compatibility packs are no longer supported and must be 
removed from your system when upgrading Security Center to version 5.12.0.0 or later. 


Before you begin 


• 
Upgrade your Omnicast system to a supported Security Center version. For more information, see the 
Omnicast Migration Guide. 
• 
Take note of how you have configured your federated entities in your Omnicast Federation role before 
you remove the role from your system. After you migrate the Omnicast system to Security Center and 
re-federate it now using the Security Center Federation role, you will have to reconfigure the federated 
entities with the same values. 
What you should know 


Omnicast Federation roles that remain in the system after the upgrade will be offline and highlighted in red. 


Procedure 
1 
From the Config Tool homepage, open the System task and click the Roles view. 
2 
Select all Omnicast Federation roles, right-click, then click Delete > Continue > Delete. 
3 
From your Windows Control Panel, open the Programs and Features applet. 
4 
In the Programs and Features window, right-click each instance of the Genetec™ Omnicast Compatibility 


Package, and then click Uninstall > Yes. 


After you finish 


Upgrade your system.

Upgrading to Security Center 5.12 


Upgrading Directory failover systems from an earlier 
major version 


Directory servers are not backward-compatible. Perform this procedure if you are upgrading Security Center 
with multiple Directory servers to the latest version or release. 


Before you begin 


• 
Read the Security Center Release Notes for important information when upgrading to Security Center 
5.12. 
• 
You need a maintenance window to upgrade all the Directory servers. This period should be scheduled at 
a time when it’s acceptable to run the system with a minimum set of features. 
• 
Back up the Directory database, all role databases, and configuration files. 
• 
Make sure to note and apply the same settings in the InstallShield that you used for your previous 
installation: passwords, database, ports, general properties, and so on. 
• 
The Config Tool and the Directory must be of the same version. 
• 
If Config Tool and the Directory are on different machines, upgrade the Config Tool before you upgrade 
the Directory. 
• 
Don’t change the Directory failover configuration before upgrading; that is, don’t remove the secondary 
Directory servers from the list of Directory servers. 
What you should know 


• 
During the upgrade, the Directory role is stopped. Therefore, Config Tool and most Security Desk features 
are not available. However, video that is displayed before the Directory service goes offline continues 
to be streamed in the Security Desk Monitoring task and saved to the Archiver. For example, video walls 
continue to display video streams. Access control continues to work as well, but operators are unable to 
use Security Desk to manually open doors, and so on. 
• 
During the upgrade, each Directory server is upgraded separately. Therefore, the failover feature isn’t 
available. 
• 
License upgrades are necessary only for major version upgrades (for example, from version 5.x to 5.12). It 
isn’t necessary to upgrade the license for minor version upgrades (for example, from 5.12.x.0 to 5.12.y.0). 
Procedure 


1 
On each of the secondary Directory servers in the Directory server list, stop the Genetec™ Watchdog 
service from the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Service window. 


The secondary Directory servers are indicated with the expansion server icon ( 
). Do not stop the main 


server ( 
). 


The Genetec™ Server service is stopped on the secondary Directory servers. All roles that run only on 
secondary Directory servers are offline. Usually each Directory server is responsible for an equal share 
of the role and client connections. After the secondary Directory servers are stopped, any roles or clients 
previously connected to one of the secondary Directory servers are forced to reconnect to the primary 
Directory server. The clients briefly show the "Connection is lost..." message during this process. The roles 
and their entities appear as offline until they are reconnected. 


2 
Upgrade the primary Directory server as the main server. 


The primary Directory server, also known as the main server ( 
), is the only server that is still active 
before you start the upgrade process. While the main server is being upgraded, no Directory service is 
available on the system. Only some features remain functional. 


Security Center Installer automatically stops the Genetec Server service on the main server, and restarts it 
after the upgrade.

Upgrading to Security Center 5.12 


3 
(Applies only to major version upgrades) Activate your Security Center 5.12 license by doing one of the 
following: 


• 
If you have internet access, use web activation. 
• 
If you don’t have internet access, use manual activation. 
During the license activation, a message warning you that the failover functionality will be broken is 
displayed. 



Don’t worry. The failover functionality will be restored later. Click I have read and I understand the 


above statement and click Continue. 
The Directory service is online. All expansion servers (except the secondary Directory servers) and client 
workstations that aren’t yet upgraded run in backward compatibility mode. Directory failover and load 
balancing aren’t yet available. 


4 
From Config Tool, connect to the main server. Check that all roles, servers, and units are running as 


expected. 
The secondary Directory servers are still stopped (in red ). Any roles that run only on the secondary 
Directory servers are still offline. 


5 
Upgrade the rest of the Directory servers as expansion servers. 
Security Center Installer restarts the Genetec™ Server service after each upgrade. Directory failover and 
load balancing are still unavailable. 


6 
(Applies only to major version upgrades) Reactivate the Security Center 5.12 license for all your Directory 
servers. 
Directory failover and load balancing are now available. 


After you finish 


Upgrade the rest of your system according to your priorities and schedule. 
IMPORTANT: Adding backward-compatible connections slows down the performance of the Directory. It is 
recommended only as a temporary solution before you can upgrade all servers and workstations.

Reactivating Security Center license for Directory failover systems 


When you add, remove, or change the servers in the Directory failover list, you must generate a new 
validation key and reactivate your Security Center license from Config Tool. 


What you should know 


When you have multiple Directory servers configured for failover, you must generate the validation key and 
apply the license key from Config Tool instead of Server Admin. 
IMPORTANT: All Directory servers must be up and running for the license update to work.

What Security Center client features are available when the 
Directory service is offline? 


During a Security Center system upgrade, all Directory servers must be shut down for a period of time. 
During this time, no Directory service is available on the system. Only some features continue to work. 


The following Security Center features are available when there is no Directory service: 


• 
Security Desk continues to stream live video from cameras. 
• 
Video continues to be recorded according to schedules as long as Archivers are online. 
• 
All access control functions continue to work as normal, except for commands that must be relayed by the 
Directory service, such as event-to-actions, and all door open or unlock operations issued from Security 
Desk. 
• 
Doors can be opened through a switch (input) if all inputs and outputs are controlled by the same access 
control unit. 
The following Security Center features are not available when there is no Directory service: 


• 
Config Tool and Security Desk features are unavailable. 
• 
All manual actions (manual recording, lock/unlock doors, and so on) performed from the Security Desk 
widgets are disabled, including camera call-ups. 
• 
Alarms and live events cannot be displayed on Security Desk.

Upgrading to Security Center 5.12 


Upgrading the Security Center main server 


The main server in your current Security Center system must be upgraded before everything else. Activate 
the new license and upgrade the Directory database. 


Before you begin 


• 
Read the things that you need to know and do before you upgrade (see related topics). 
• 
Back up your Directory database and all role databases accessed from your main server. 
BEST PRACTICE: There is an option in the InstallShield Wizard to back up your Directory database after 
the software upgrade, before restarting your system. Depending on the size of your database, this backup 
might take several hours. To accelerate your upgrade process, you can back up your Directory database 
before upgrading the software. Then, when the InstallShield Wizard reaches the Directory Database Backup 
step, you can choose to skip the backup. However, if you choose to let Genetec™ Update Service (GUS) 
perform the upgrade, do not back up the Directory database yourself, because GUS always does it for you. 


• 
Make sure that you have enough disk space for your backup. Delete the backups that you no longer need. 
The default backup folder is C:\SecurityCenterBackup on the server hosting SQL Server. 
• 
In Security Center 5.12.0.0 and later, Omnicast™ Federation™ is disabled and no longer supported. Remove 
all Omnicast Federation roles before upgrading your system. 
What you should know 


You need the Security Center 5.12 Config Tool to connect it to the 5.12 Directory. If the Security Center Client 
is installed on the main server, upgrade it at the same time. 


If a reboot warning message box opens during the upgrade, accept the message and continue with the 
upgrade procedure. You must reboot after completing the upgrade.

Upgrading to Security Center 5.12 


1 
Install Security Center 5.12 on your main server. 
If you have Genetec Advantage and are subscribed to our Product Improvement Program, and if the 
version you want to install corresponds to the most up-to-date version, you can perform the upgrade 
through Genetec™ Update Service instead of the installer. 



If you choose to continue with GUS, the Installer program ends and automatically connects you to 
the Main GUS. The Main GUS displays a centralized view of all enrolled machines and sends update 
notifications to them. GUS always backs up the Directory database for you, so you do not need to do it 
before the upgrade. For more information, see About the Genetec Update Service. 


If you choose to continue with the installer, the Installer program automatically detects an earlier version 
of Security Center and issues warnings and recommendations. Read the messages carefully. 



If you continue, the Installer program upgrades Security Center to 5.12.

On the Directory Database Backup page, acknowledge the date of the last Directory database backup, and 
click Next to continue the installation. 



If you select the automatic backup option, the Directory database will be backed up after the software 


upgrade, but before the database upgrade. 


NOTE: For the last Directory database backup date, the Installer does not differentiate between full and 
incremental backups. It also does not check whether the backup files are still available. The automatic 
backup option always performs a full backup. 


IMPORTANT: It is possible that the date of the last Directory database backup is inaccurate if the last 
backup was performed outside of Security Center. Regardless, we strongly recommend that you back up 
your Directory database before upgrading, or let the installer do it for you. The option to automatically 
back up the Directory database is selected by default if the last backup is more than a day old. Do not 
clear this option if you are not sure whether the most recent changes are included in the last backup. 


5 
Follow the rest of the InstallShield Wizard instructions, and click Install. 
The installer updates your Security Center software, backs up the Directory database (if you selected the 
option), updates the schema of your Directory database (if applicable), and launches Server Admin.

Back up manually. This is the recommended option. It opens the Backup/Restore dialog box. 
When a backup fails, it is often because you do not have access to the backup folder. If you need to 
change the backup folder, close this dialog box, select the main server from the list of servers, and 
click Database properties ( 
). In the dialog box that opens, enter the new Destination folder.

After the Directory database is successfully backed up, the system restarts. If a database update is 
required, it is performed automatically before restarting the Directory. 


• 
Skip the backup. Choose this option only if you are sure that the latest backup has all the changes you 
need. If a database update is required, it is performed automatically. If you do not have a backup of 
your database, you will not be able to restore it if necessary.

Upgrading Security Center Client 


After you upgrade the Security Center main server and expansion servers, you can upgrade Security Center 
Client. 


What you should know 


The Security Center 5.12 Client is installed side by side with previous Security Center Client versions. 


From Security Center 5.4, Client settings are automatically carried over to new Client versions. 


During the installation of a new version, you have the option to simultaneously remove earlier client versions 
and accompanying driver packs. 


TIP: If the workstations on your system are enrolled in Genetec™ Update Service (GUS), you can install the 
latest Security Center Client on all of them at the same time from the Main GUS. For more information, see 
About the Products tab. 


Procedure 


• 
Install Security Center Client. 
The installer automatically detects an earlier version of Security Center software and applies the current 
settings to 5.12.

Upgrading to Security Center 5.12 


Upgrading the Security Center Directory database 


The Security Center 5.12 Installer upgrades the Directory database as part of the main server upgrade. You 
need to upgrade the Directory database manually only if you restored an older version of the database. 


What you should know 


After restoring an older version of the Directory database, Server Admin notifies you that a database update 


is required. 
BEST PRACTICE: Before you upgrade, back up your database in a secure location that is separate from your 
main server. 



Procedure 


1 
Do one of the following: 


• 
Click Database with the flashing red LED. 
• 
Click Database update ( 
) in the Directory section. 
The Directory database update starts, and the database server status shows Upgrading. 


2 
While the database is being upgraded, click Show progress ( 
) to view the progress of the upgrade. 
When the upgrade is completed, the Status shows OK. 


3 
Click Database properties ( 
) to confirm the version of the database and the number of entities in the 
database. 


4 
Log off from Server Admin, and then log on to Config Tool. 


5 
Open the System task, and select Roles. 


6 
Select the Archiver role, and click Resources.

Upgrading to Security Center 5.12 


7 
In the Actions section, click Database update ( 
) . 



After the upgrade is complete, the Database status indicates Connected. 


8 
Repeat the steps for every role that requires a database update. The roles on your system vary depending 
on your license options. 


After you finish 


Shrink the Archiver database, and if necessary, other databases that you have upgraded. 


Shrinking Security Center databases after an upgrade 


After a database upgrade, disk usage might increase due to the temporary storage required to execute 
the upgrade transactions. The disk space used during the upgrade is not automatically released after the 
upgrade is complete. To reclaim the unused disk space, you must shrink the database. 


Before you begin 


Not all database upgrades cause the database to grow in size. If you are not sure whether or not you need to 
shrink your database after an upgrade, check the disk usage with SQL Server Management Studio. 


What you should know 


Depending on the recovery model of your database, a transaction log backup might be required to reclaim 
the unused disk space. For more information, see the following online articles:

Upgrading Security Center with Global Cardholder 
Synchronizer roles 


To upgrade a composite Security Center system involving Global Cardholder Synchronizer (GCS) roles, you 
must upgrade the sharing host system first, then upgrade the sharing guest systems. 


Before you begin 


Back up the Directory databases of your sharing host and sharing guest systems. 


What you should know 


The Global Cardholder Synchronizer (GCS) role ensures the two-way synchronization of shared cardholders 
and their related entities between the local system (sharing guest) where it resides and the central system 
(sharing host). For more information, see Global cardholder management. 


Procedure 


1 
Disconnect the sharing guests from the sharing host. 
Do one of the following: 


• 
Deactivate the GCS roles on the sharing guest systems. 
• 
Temporarily change the passwords of the GCS role user accounts. 
2 
Upgrade the sharing host system first. 
3 
Upgrade the sharing guest systems next. 
4 
Confirm that the upgrades were successful. 
5 
Reconnect the sharing guests to the sharing host. 


Do one of the following: 


• 
If you deactivated the GCS roles on the sharing guest systems, reactivate them. 
• 
If you changed the passwords of the GCS role user accounts, change them back. 
6 
Give the sharing guests some time to sync with the sharing host.

Automating Security Center installation 


Silent installation of Security Center 


A silent installation is an automated way of installing software without user intervention. The silent 
installation is run from the command line using the Security Center setup.exe executable, and Windows 
Installer commands. 


You can customize the following options from the command line: 


• 
Installation language 
• 
Application language 
• 
Client or Server installation path 
• 
Client or Server features to install 
• 
Server username and password for running the services 
• 
Server and database name 
Limitations 


Take note of the following limitations before performing a silent installation: 


• 
You cannot update your license in silent mode. You will need to run the Server Admin application after 
installing Security Center to activate the license. 
• 
A command line is limited to a maximum of 850 characters. 
TIP: One way to shorten the command-line length is to reduce the installation path length. This can be 
achieved by copying the installation files onto a local drive. 


• 
You cannot use mapped drives in your path specifications. 
• 
The installer options for a silent installation of Security Center are supported only for major and minor 
releases, and not for patch releases. For instructions on how to install cumulative updates of Security 
Center in silent mode, see the release notes for any patch release. 
Silent installation of the Security Center Drivers 


To install the Security Center Drivers in silent mode, you need to ask your Genetec Inc. representative for the 
separate driver installation package, and use the following syntax: 


setup.exe /s /v"/qn /l*v "<msiLog>" <restart_option>" 


where: 


• 
setup.exe is the setup program found in the root folder of the Drivers installation package. 
• 
<msiLog> is the path to the MSI log file. The folder path must exist. The setup program does not create it. 
Example: "C:\Users\Public\install.log" 


• 
<restart_option> indicates whether or not to restart the Genetec™ Server service after installation. 
• 
RESTART_GENETEC_SERVER=1 (default) 
• 
RESTART_GENETEC_SERVER=0 


If you choose not to restart Genetec Server right away, you must restart it later for the new drivers to take 
effect. 


Silent installation of the Security Center SDK 


To install the Security Center SDK in silent mode using the separate SDK installation package, see Silent 
installation options for Security Center SDK on page 147.

Automating Security Center installation 


Preparing to perform a silent installation 


There are certain tasks you should perform prior to the installation to ensure it goes smoothly. 


Procedure 


1 
Install the Security Center prerequisites. 
Security Center installer automatically verifies and installs the software prerequisites on your system. 
This might cause your system to restart. Therefore, it is best practice to manually install the software 
prerequisites before launching the silent installer. 


2 
Apply the latest Windows updates. 


3 
If you specify a different Windows user than the default (Local System) to run the services, then that user 


must be created before you begin the installation process. 
The user must be a member of the Administrators group and must have the Log on as service user 
privilege.

Silent installation options for Security Center 


When performing a silent installation, specific program options are required to run the Security Center 
Installer. 


The syntax for running the setup in silent mode is: 


<setup_exe> <options> <SC_options> 


where: 


• 
<setup_exe> is the setup program for the Security Center Installer. You can either use the 
standalone version ("Security Center Setup.exe" found in the SC Packages folder) or the web version 
(SecurityCenterWebSetup.exe). 
Do not use the setup.exe in the root folder of the installation package. It is an AutoRun-enabled version of 
the standalone installer, and does not accept command-line arguments. 


• 
<options> are the setup program options. They all start with a forward slash (/) and are case-sensitive. 
• 
<SC_options> are the Security Center options. They are all written in capital letters. 
The following table describes the setup options. 
Setup optionDescription
/ISInstallDir 
Specifies the root folder in which to create the product subfolder. Default: 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Genetec Security Center 
5.12. 


EXAMPLES: 


• 
/ISInstallDir=C:\MyFolder 
• 
/ISInstallDir="D:\Program Files\MyFolder" 
NOTE: In the second example, the (") are required because the value 
contains spaces. If not specified, the default is <ProgramFiles>, where 
<ProgramFiles> is either %PROGRAMFILES% or %PROGRAMFILES(X86)%, 
depending on the version of your operating system. 


CAUTION: The folder path cannot end with a trailing backslash (\). This 
causes the silent installation to fail with a fatal error. 


/ISFeatureInstall 
Specifies the features to be installed. The possible values are: 


• 
Server (Genetec™ Server with or without Directory, depends on the 
SERVER_TYPE installer option) 
• 
Client (Security Desk and Config Tool) 
• 
SecurityDesk (only Security Desk) 
• 
ConfigTool (only Config Tool) 
EXAMPLES: 
• 
/ISFeatureInstall=Server,Client (DEFAULT) 
/silent 
Sets the Security Center setup.exe program to run in silent mode with no 
user interaction. 
/DebugLog<FilePath\LogFileName> 
Enables the creation of the installation log file and specifies the file path. 
NOTE: The folder path specified in <FilePath> must exist. The setup 
program does not create it. 
EXAMPLE: /debuglog"C:\LogFiles\Install.log"

EXAMPLES 


• 
/language:1033 for English (DEFAULT) 
• 
/language:3084 for French 
<SecurityCenter_options> 
Sets the Security Center options. 


Each option in this list uses the following syntax: 


<option>=<value_list> 


where <option> is an option name and <value_list> is a list of comma-
separated values. 


No space is allowed on either side of the equal sign (=). If the value list 
must contain spaces, the entire value list must be included between a 
pair of double quotes preceded by a backslash (\").

Automating Security Center installation 


Sample Security Center installation commands 


Using the different command options, you can customize your Security Center Server silent installation. 


Unless stated otherwise, all server installation examples below assume that the server does not have SQL 
Server installed. 


• 
If you want to use an existing SQL server, use SQLSERVER_GROUP=ExistingServer or 
SQLSERVER_GROUP=AzureServer instead. 
• 
If the local instance is not named (LOCAL)\SQLEXPRESS or if the instance is not LOCAL, use GLOBAL_SERVER 
to set the instance name. 
The /debuglog and /log folders must exist before launching the install. If desired, you can omit the / 
silent parameter. The installation graphical user interface appears with fields filled with values from the 
parameters. 


Example 


Typical scenario: A full installation of Genetec™ Server with the Directory and the clients (Config Tool and 
Security Desk) are installed in English. The files are installed in C:\Program Files (x86)\Genetec Security Center 


x.xx. The log files are saved to C:\MyLogs. An instance of SQL Server is created called (LOCAL)\SQLExpress. The 
data collection policy is set to ON. Setup runs in silent mode. 
"Security Center Setup.exe" /silent /debuglog"C:\MyLogs\Install.log" /log"C: 
\MyLogs\" /ISFeatureInstall=Server,Client AGREETOLICENSE=Yes COLLECTPOLICY=OnMAINSERVER_PASSWORD=ServerPwd-123 SQLSERVER_GROUP=NewServer 


Example 


A standard installation of Genetec™ Server as the main server, without the clients. The data collection policy is 
set to anonymous. Both the installation and the Security Center applications are in English. 


"Security Center Setup.exe" /silent /debuglog"C:\MyLogs\Install.log" /log"C: 
\MyLogs\" /ISFeatureInstall=Server AGREETOLICENSE=Yes COLLECTPOLICY=AnonymousMAINSERVER_PASSWORD=ServerPwd-123 SQLSERVER_GROUP=NewServer 


Example 


Security Desk and Config Tool are installed in English (default), in silent mode. The log files are saved to C: 
\MyLogs. 


"Security Center Setup.exe" /silent /debuglog"C:\MyLogs\Install.log" /log"C:\MyLogs\" /ISFeatureInstall=ConfigTool,SecurityDesk SERVERADMIN_PASSWORD="SeCret123!" 
AGREETOLICENSE=Yes 


Example 


A standard installation of Genetec™ Server as an expansion server, without a SQL Server. Only the installation 
path is different. Both the installation and the Security Center applications use the default language, which is 
English. 


"Security Center Setup.exe" /silent /debuglog"C:\MyLogs\Install.log" /log"C:\MyLogs\" /ISFeatureInstall=Server /ISInstallDir="c:\GENETEC_PATH" AGREETOLICENSE=Yes

Silent installation options for Security Center SDK 


You can install the Security Center SDK from a separate package instead of using the full Security Center 
installation package. If you are using this separate package, be aware that the silent SDK installation options 
are slightly different from those of Security Center. 


Command syntax 


The syntax for running the setup in silent mode is: 


setup.exe /debuglog<setupLog> /s /v"/qn /l*v <msiLog> <SDK_options>" 


where: 


• 
setup.exe is the setup program found in the root folder of the SDK installation package. 
• 
<setupLog> is the path to the setup log file. The folder path must exist. The setup program does not create 
it. 
• 
<msiLog> is the path to the MSI log file. The folder path must exist. The setup program does not create it. 
• 
<SDK_options> are the Security Center SDK options. 
An option follows the <option>=<value> syntax, where <option> is written in all caps. No space is allowed on 
either side of the equal sign (=). If the value contains spaces, the value must be included between double 
quotes. 


SDK options 


The following table describes the SDK options.

Troubleshooting 


Disabling the SQL Server telemetry service manually 


If the Security Center Installer fails to disable the SQL Server telemetry service, you can disable it manually 
after Security Center is installed. 


What you should know 


Microsoft installs the SQL Server Telemetry or CEIP (Customer Experience Improvement Program) Services 
as part of the SQL Server 2022 Express Advanced installation. The telemetry service sends feature usage info 
back to Microsoft. The Security Center Installer always tries to disable this service. When it fails, you get a 
warning message at the end of the Security Center installation so you can disable it manually. 


Procedure 
1 
Run services.msc in Windows, and disable the SQL Server CEIP service. 



2 
In the Windows Start menu, type regedit, and then press ENTER. 
3 
In the Registry Editor, set the following registry entries to zero (0): 


• 
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\150 
• 
CustomerFeedback REG_DWORD 
• 
EnableErrorReporting REG_DWORD

Troubleshooting 


Restoring missing MSI files in Windows cache 


If your Security Center installation is interrupted due to missing MSI (Microsoft Software Installer) files in the 
Windows cache, you can download a Microsoft tool to help you restore the missing files. 


What you should know 


When you install an application using an MSI package, Windows Installer caches the essential files. This 
caching ensures that you can later modify or uninstall the application even if the original setup source is no 
longer available. However, these cached MSI files might sometimes become unavailable for the following 
reasons: 


• 
Network share inaccessibility: If the network share from which the application was initially installed 
becomes inaccessible, the cached MSI might not be usable. 
• 
Storage constraints: If the cached MSI lacks necessary storage (such as cabinet files), Windows Installer 
resorts to the source list resolution process. 
• 
Corruption or deletion: Corruption or accidental deletion of the cached MSI can render it unusable. 
• 
Third-party tools: Some third-party tools might delete cached MSI files during cleanup. 
If any cached MSI files are missing, the Installation Interrupted page appears, with information on how to 
resolve the issue.

Troubleshooting 


Cameras stop working after installing Security Center with 
the default security options 


After installing Security Center using default security settings, cameras that do not support digest access 
authentication might not work. To fix this issue, you can reactivate basic access authentication by video unit 
or by manufacturer. 


What you should know 


Digest access authentication is the authentication scheme that most recent video unit models support. This 
authentication scheme is more secure than basic access authentication because the passwords are hashed 
before sending them over the network. For this reason, basic access authentication is disabled by default. 
After installation, if you realize that some of your cameras do not support digest access authentication, you 
can revert them to basic access authentication in Config Tool. 


For added security, Security Center remembers whether or not a specific video unit supports the digest 
authentication scheme. You can see the authentication scheme used for each camera in the Hardware 
inventory report. 


NOTE: After the system has successfully authenticated to a video unit using the digest scheme, you cannot 
revert to the less secure basic scheme. 


Procedure 


To reactivate basic authentication on a specific video unit: 


1 
From Config Tool, open the Hardware inventory task. 
2 
Run the report on the video units that are inactive (in red) in your system. 
You might need to scroll horizontally to the right to see the Authentication scheme column. 
3 
In the report pane, select the video units that are inactive and click Reset authentication scheme. 
The Authentication scheme changes to Anonymous. After the Archiver successfully connects to the 
video unit, the exact authentication scheme is displayed. 


To reactivate basic authentication for a specific manufacturer: 


1 
From Config Tool, open the Video task. 
2 
Select the Archiver role that controls your cameras and click Extensions. 
3 
Select the manufacturer that you want and set Refuse basic authentication to OFF. 
4 
Click Apply.

Error when installing Microsoft .NET Framework, Return 
Code: 0x800f081f 


If your Security Center installation on a Windows 10 or 11 machine is interrupted with the return code 
0x800f081f, you must use your Windows 10 or 11 installation disk (or a virtual copy of it) to turn on .NET 
Framework 3.5, and rerun the Security Center installation. 


What you should know 


Security Center requires the feature .NET Framework 3.5 to be turned on in order to work. Security Center 
installer turns .NET Framework 3.5 on by default. However, this feature cannot be turned on if you are 
missing the .NET 3.5.1 files, which causes the error 0x800f081f. 


Procedure 


1 
Get a copy of the Windows 10 or 11 installation disk (or a virtual copy of it) from your IT department, and 
make sure it is accessible from the computer where Security Center needs to be installed. 
2 
Open a command prompt with full administrator rights. 
For more information, see How to Open an Elevated Command Prompt. 
3 
Enter the following command: 


DISM /online /enable-feature /featurename:NetFx3 /All /Source:F:\sources\sxs 


where F: is the drive letter where the installation disk or virtual disk with the Windows 10 or 11 setup files 
are located. 


The command prompt will run through a repair and activation of the .NET framework feature. 
4 
Close the command prompt. 
5 
From the Windows Control Panel, open the Programs and Features applet and click Turn Windows 


features on or off. 
6 
In the Windows Features dialog box, click .NET Framework 3.5, and then click OK. 
7

Troubleshooting 


Exported PDF reports in Japanese or Chinese contain 
invalid characters when running a different OS language 


If you are exporting a report as a PDF in Japanese or Chinese (Simplified or traditional), and the output 
contains invalid characters, you might need to install supplemental fonts. 


What you should know 


This issue would only happen if the Windows display language is different from the language in the report. 
Our PDF generator does not support the Windows default fonts for these languages, so you will need to 
manually install supplemental fonts. 


Procedure 


1 
In the Windows taskbar, click Start > Settings > Apps > Apps & features > Optional features > Add a 
feature. 


2 
From the list, select the applicable language pack:

collaborative incident 


A collaborative incident is an incident type that requires the collaboration of multiple teams to resolve. 
Each team has specific tasks to follow, which are represented by sub-incidents. The collaborative incident is 
resolved when all its sub-incidents are resolved. 


Config Tool 


Config Tool is the Security Center administrative application used to manage all Security Center users and to 
configure all Security Center entities such as areas, cameras, doors, schedules, cardholders, patrol vehicles, 
ALPR units, and hardware devices. 


Conflict resolution utility 


The Conflict resolution utility is a tool that helps you resolve conflicts caused by importing users and 
cardholders from an Active Directory. 


context camera 


A context camera is a camera connected to an ALPR unit that produces a wider angle color image of the 
vehicle whose license plate was read by the ALPR camera. 


contract permit parking 


Contract permit parking is a parking scenario where only drivers with monthly permits can park in the 
parking zone. A whitelist is used to grant permit holders access to the parking zone. 


controlled exit 


A controlled exit is when credentials are necessary to leave a secured area. 


controller module 


Controller module is the processing component of Synergis™ Master Controller with IP capability. This 
module comes pre-loaded with the controller firmware and the web-based administration tool, Synergis™ 
Appliance Portal. 


convenience time 


The convenience time is a configurable leeway time before a vehicle starts to be charged after entering the 
parking zone. For example, if you need to set up a 2-hour free parking period before paid time or parking 
enforcement takes effect, you would set the convenience time for 2 hours. For parking lots where parking 
enforcement begins immediately, you would still need to set a short convenience time to allow vehicle 
owners time to find a parking spot and purchase parking time before parking enforcement begins. 


Copy configuration tool 


The Copy configuration tool helps you save configuration time by copying the settings of one entity to many 
others that partially share the same settings. 


correlation 


Correlation refers to the relationship that exists between two types of events, X and Y. A correlation exists 
between X and Y if whenever event X occurs, event Y is expected. For example, if we observe that every time 
there is a large gathering of people (event X), the number of new cases of COVID-19 increases in the days 
that follow (event Y), we can assume that there is a correlation between large gatherings and the increase in 
the number of new cases of COVID-19. 


covert hit 


A covert hit is a read (captured license plate) that is matched to a covert hotlist. Covert hits are not displayed 
on the Genetec Patroller™ screen, but can be displayed in Security Desk by a user with proper privileges. 


covert hotlist 


Covert hotlists allow you to ensure the discretion of an ongoing investigation or special operation. When a hit 
is identified, only the authorized officer at the Security Center station is notified, while the officer in the patrol 
vehicle is not alerted. This enables enforcement officials to assign multiple objectives to the vehicle and back-
end systems, while not interrupting the priorities of officers on duty.

changing states, possibly confusing the logical circuitry. Debouncing is used to filter out unstable signals by 
ignoring all state changes that are shorter than a certain period (in milliseconds). 


default expiration delay 


The default expiration delay is used for permits supplied by Pay-by-Plate Sync that do not include an 
expiration. In this case, AutoVu™ Free-Flow checks with the parking permit provider to see if the permit is 
still valid. Increasing this value reduces the frequency of the permit checks. For example, if the parking lot 
charges for parking in increments of 15 minutes, and you also set the default expiration delay to 15 minutes, 
the system validates the permit with the parking provider every 15 minutes.

certificates are used for identity verification, asymmetric cryptography, data-in-transit security, and so on. 
Digital certificates are the basis for the HTTPS protocol. 


digital signature 


A digital signature is cryptographic metadata added to video frames by the Archiver or Auxiliary Archiver to 
ensure their authenticity. If a video sequence is manipulated by adding, deleting, or modifying frames, the 
signature of the modified content will differ from the original, indicating that the video sequence has been 
tampered with. 


digital signature origin 


A digital signature origin is a string of code that contains the Archiver ID of a Security Center system and an 
encrypted copy of the public key it uses for digital signatures. This string of code can be generated from the 
system and from each G64x video file its Archiver creates. The origins can then be compared for a match 
when validating the source Archiver for the digital signature of a file. 


Directory 


The Directory role identifies a Security Center system. It manages all entity configurations and system-wide 
settings. 
Only a single instance of this role is permitted on your system. The server hosting the Directory 
role is called the main server, and must be set up first. All other servers you add in Security Center are called 
expansion servers, and must connect to the main server to be part of the same system. 


Directory authentication 


Directory authentication is a Security Center option that forces all client and server applications on a given 
machine to validate the identity certificate of the Directory before connecting to it. This measure prevents 
manipulator-in-the-middle attacks. 


Directory gateway 


Directory gateways allow Security Center applications located on a non-secured network to connect to the 
main server that is behind a firewall. A Directory gateway is a Security Center server that acts as a proxy 
for the main server. A server cannot be both a Directory server and a Directory gateway; the former must 
connect to the Directory database, while the latter must not, for security reasons.
